This is a sanitized version of the Puppet code I use to manage and maintain my on-prem VMware homelab. This is a master-less Puppet infrastructure, which keeps it simple by making use of git and cron to manage a small fleet of virtual machines. You can see an example of the very simple cron that verifies another run isn't in progres and if not, performs ```git pull```, ```puppet apply```, here: <a href="https://github.com/x86txt/portfolio/blob/main/puppet/environments/production/modules/base_module/files/common/puppet_cron">puppet/environments/production/modules/base_module/files/common/puppet_cron</a>
