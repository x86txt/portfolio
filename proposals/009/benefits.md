## Benefits

### Cost Efficiency

The cloud is both cost effective and cost prohibitive, depending on the lens through which it is viewed. In this proposal, we will use the lens of 'flexibility and convenience' when we discuss costs. Those are hard to quantify, but we will assume the marginal cost to implement multi-cloud is outweighed by the ability to place workloads in the cloud with the lowest costs at that moment, the improvement to disaster recovery, availability, and the nuances of each cloud's performance per product.

### High Availability and Disaster Recovery

Although major cloud outages are rare, they do occur, and so this solution allows for both the control plane and individual workloads to be run and shifted between cloud providers, with minimal manual work. This will serve to provide both high availability and disaster recovery intrinsically, without a separate solution being required.

### Flexibility and Vendor Neutrality

There is a non-insignificant percentage of decision makers who are passionate about Amazon, Microsoft, and/or Google. Often they will 'hold their nose' and use a provider, but if Cyware had the ability to allow a customer to choose the cloud provider and region where their application tenant is deployed, it would serve as an additional 'hook' to bring customers in by offering them a choice Cyware's competitors do not. 

Further, this allows Cyware to offer cheaper and more direct integration with a customer who may have workloads in a specific cloud provider and therefore, may balk as egress or transit costs to get their data out of their existing cloud provider and into a different provider. 

Finally, allowing a customer to choose their cloud provider and region would greatly lessen the spider-web of global compliance requirements and allow Cyware to more rapidly serve customers around the world.
