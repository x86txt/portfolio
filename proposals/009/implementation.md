## Implementation Plan

A detailed implementation plan is beyond the scope of this document, but I wanted to include this section for completeness. If this were an actual plan, this section would detail exactly how we planned to tackle each phase of the project, from initial stakeholder discussions, the initial migration into AWS, the extension into Azure and/or GCP, milestones, resource allocations, and what will constitute "success."
