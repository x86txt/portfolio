### Overview of Project Scope

Without fully understanding all the intricacies of the Cyware Platform, we'll just use a hypothetical timeline of 6 months for this full scope of work. That should allow sufficient time for proof-of-concept, testing & validation, a stepped-deployment process, and finally retirement of the old infrastructure.

### In-Scope Activities

1. Discussions with stakeholders to ensure all voices are heard.
2. Solicitation for Technologies to Evaluate, i.e. Pros/Cons
3. Selection of Technologies
4. Deployment of Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Environment
5. Evalution in PoC environment by stakeholders
6. Testing, Validation, functional QA testing, end-user QA and acceptance
7. Initial Deployment into AWS and migration away from Docker Swarm
8. Extension of Kubernetes Control Plane into Azure or GCP
9. Extension of Node Components into Azure or GCP
10. Extending CI/CD solution for multi-cloud
11. Plan to educate and upskill SRE, DevOps, and Security Staff

### Out-of-Scope Activities

We won't discuss necessary but unrelated items such as securing the cloud, securing the CI/CD solution, transit or egress costs, or playbooks for how to support the solution. Although those are extremely important and would be part of an actual solution proposal, they depend on details that are unknown to me at this point. There will be high-level suggestions for several of these topics, but plans for their ultimate implementation are beyond the scope of this project.
