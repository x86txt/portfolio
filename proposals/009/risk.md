## Risk Assessment

### Identified Risks

In this section, we would identify risks, not only form a technical perspective, but to the business as a whole. Some risks might be the consequence of moving an engineer off a feature and over onto this project, it might be if there are any impacts to cost by choosing multi-cloud instead of a long-term contract with a single provider, if the move to multi-cloud introduces information security or compliance problems we don't feel we have the expertise to solve or adequate mitigations for. This is a very important part of the overall solution and we should strive to identify risks at every phase of the project, from start, during implementation, and once it is deployed and we are about to sign-off as complete.

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

As a result of the discussions above, we should discuss and document all strategies for mitigation, or even accepting, identified risk. We should also strive to build in automated checks where possible to prevent regression as the environment organically grows.
